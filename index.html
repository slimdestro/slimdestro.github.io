            <strong>Kong Gateway for VoD Access Control & Filtering</strong>
            <span class="label skill"><i class="fab fa-golang"></i> Kong Gateway | Go | OTT</span>
            <p>Designed and deployed a scalable Kong API gateway for a global VoD data API, enabling dynamic, fine-grained access control and metadata filtering to secure data for hundreds of partners.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a custom Go-based gRPC plugin for Kong to enforce unique access policies per API key, controlling which VoD platforms a consumer could query.</li>
                <li>Engineered a dynamic response filtering logic in Go to expose only the specific metadata fields a consumer was permitted to see, ensuring data privacy and compliance.</li>
                <li>Architected the system to handle all traffic for the main search API, centralizing security, rate-limiting, and governance for all API consumers.</li>

            <span class="label skill"><i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python | Flask | Redis</span>
            <p>Developed a high-trust digital document platform for legally binding e-signatures and multi-stage verification with biometric validation, streamlining the signing process and ensuring compliance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a Flask-based API gateway to manage the entire document lifecycle, from secure uploads to multi-party signature workflows with comprehensive audit trails.</li>
                <li>Integrated OpenCV to perform real-time biometric validation by matching a user’s signature against their government ID, adding a critical layer of security.</li>
                <li>Utilized Celery workers and Redis to offload CPU-intensive verification tasks (e.g., watermarking, hash validation) to background queues, ensuring the API remained responsive.</li>

            <strong>Enterprise API Gateway for Legacy System Modernization</strong>
            <span class="label skill"> PHP | Symfony | RabbitMQ | Redis | Kubernetes</span>
            <p>Architected and developed a high-performance API Gateway using Symfony, which was instrumental in decoupling over 20 modern applications from a monolithic legacy system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented fine-grained access control and dynamic routing policies, securing API interactions and ensuring that each consumer application had only the permissions it needed.</li>
                <li>Orchestrated asynchronous data synchronization workflows via RabbitMQ, handling complex event-driven updates and ensuring eventual consistency across distributed services.</li>
                <li>Integrated Redis for robust caching, dynamic rate limiting, and API key revocation, which significantly improved response times and system resilience under heavy load.</li>
